## What is PyScanCf?

Creates Py-ART compatible cf-radial data from individual sweeps of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Radar data

### Description

PyScanCf is a library for creating cfradial (polar) data from IMD radars that contain all 10 sweeps from single scans which are named as (Polar_ABC.nc) as well as gridded radar data from which are named as (grid_ABC.nc). Both formats are compatible for PyART. It uses Pyart to create grid data, so please remember to cite **Py-ART** as well.

## Installation

Installing PyScanCf from source is the only way to get the latest updates and
enhancement to the software that have not yet made it into a release.
The latest source code for PyScanCf can be obtained from the GitHub repository,
<https://github.com/syedhamidali/PyScanCf.git>.

How to install:

```
conda create -n pcf python=3.9 jupyter arm_pyart pandas wradlib git -c conda-forge
conda activate pcf
pip install git+https://github.com/syedhamidali/PyScanCf.git
```

Or, to install in your home directory, use:

```
git clone https://github.com/syedhamidali/PyScanCf.git

## Quick Usage

Import Library:

```
import pyscancf as pcf
import pyart
import glob
```

Mention the data path:

```
inp = "../imd_temp_radar/B/"
out = "../imd_temp_radar/out/"
```

Convert data to cfradial, and gridded format:

```
pcf.cfrad(input_dir=inp, output_dir=out, scan_type="B", gridder=True)
```

output:

```
Number of files:  20
Total number of files will be created:  2
Merging all scans in one file
Data merging done
Total Time Elapsed:  0:00:35.931653
```

Plot Cappi:

```
files = glob.glob(out+"grid*")
for file in files:
    grid = pyart.io.read_grid(file)
    pcf.plot_cappi(grid, "REF",
                cmap="pyart_HomeyerRainbow", #optional
                crosshair=False, #optional
                savedir=out) #optional
```

And you'll see the beautiful gridded data plot in your notebook,
the figures will be saved in the directory from where you launched the notebook
