# PyScanCf

Creates Py-ART compatible cf-radial data from individual sweeps of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Radar data

## Description

PyScanCf is a library for creating cfradial (polar) data from IMD radars that contain all 10 sweeps from single scans which are named as (Polar_ABC.nc) as well as gridded radar data from which are named as (grid_ABC.nc). Both formats are compatible for PyART. It uses Pyart to create grid data, so please remember to cite **Py-ART** as well.

### Documentation

Import Library::

    from pyscancf import pyscancf as pcf

Mention the data path::

    inp = '/Users/rizvi/Downloads/goa16'

Convert data to cfradial format::

    pcf.cfrad(inp,inp,True,'REF')

And you'll see the beautiful gridded data plot in your notebook,
the figures will be saved in the directory from where you launched the notebook
